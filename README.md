### Abstract
This paper seeks to take sub-pixel interpolation used for video compression and minimize the power that the process consumes using approximate computing. This paper will focus on HEVC H.265 video compression protocol and its method of sub-pixel interpolation to create more accurate motion vectors. It seeks to not only explain how sub-pixel interpolation works and why it needs to be fixed but also to find solutions for the problem at hand. It explains the process through which we intend to approach the problem and solve it by simulating potential solutions on an FPGA to determine a best solution trading-off power and accuracy. This trade-off between power and accuracy is made through approximate computing, which simplifies the methods through which we compute the values for our sub-pixel interpolation without losing too much information.
